# handy-dandy-meta-data-exporter
Python script to export metadata to excel

Use this script if you want to grab metadata from image files.

To run, simply clone the reponsitory locally, point the directories in the script to the directory with the images you want to extract, and hit run.

This will grab all the meta data, and pop it into an excel file for you :)
