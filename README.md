# handy-dandy-meta-data-exporter
Python script to export metadata to from image files excel

Use this script if you want to grab metadata from image files in a directory.

To run, simply clone the master branch locally, point the directories in the script to the directory with the images you want to extract, and hit run! 

This will grab all the meta data, and pop it into a neat and tidy excel file :)
